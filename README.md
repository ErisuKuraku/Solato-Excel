![BannerImage](https://github.com/ErisuKuraku/Solato-Excel/blob/main/Solato%20Excel%20Banner.png?raw=true)

## System Requirements

- You need a Windows PC
- At least Python 3

## Development Notes

1. You need access to excel to generate the planets randomly.
   - You cannot use excel online or other office suites (like LibreOffice Calc)
   - You need marcos enabled (excel will prompt this on first open)

2. While only exes are provided on release, you can build the alpha to work on other OSes that python supports
    - We would like to add MacOS support but don't have Mac machines to test or build. Contribution would be helpful in this matter [Email Here](mailto:github@bakugo.me) or open an pull request with an added folder 'mac' with the binaries


## Special Thanks!

Special thanks to [VBA-tools](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-JSON) for their great module to Excel VBA. Without it we woudn't be able to convert Excel sheets to JSON üëç
