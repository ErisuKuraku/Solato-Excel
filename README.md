![BannerImage](https://github.com/ErisuKuraku/Solato-Excel/blob/main/Solato%20Excel%20Banner.png?raw=true)

(In development)

For now, the Excel portion will be not uploaded here until the alpha phase is complete. This is to prevent issues with version history.

## System Requirements

- You need a Windows PC
- At least Python 3

## Development Notes

1. You will soon need access to excel to generate the planets randomly.
   - You cannot use excel online or other office suites (like LibreOffice Calc)
   - You need marcros enabled (excel will prompt this on first open)

2. While only exes are provided on release, you can build the aplha to work on other OSes that python supports
    - We would like to add MacOS support but have to Mac machines to test or build. Contrabution would be helpful in this matter [Email Here](mailto:github@bakugo.me) or open an pull request with an added folder 'mac' with the binaries

3. There wont be an attachment to the excel worksheet while development is still going on. Version history is harder to pull off using the inbuilt VBA.
    - Nothing Excel related wont be uploaded until the python program starts to pull from such program
